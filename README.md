Adobe After Effects Plug-in

Developed using the After Effects SDK combining C++ and JavaScript to extend the capabilities of Adobe After Effects. The project integrates C++ for low-level system interactions, such as key press detections, and JavaScript for scripting within the After Effects environment.

Key Features:

Utilizes the After Effects SDK for deep integration with Adobe After Effects.
Employs C++ to access Windows library features for enhanced functionality.
Incorporates JavaScript for easy scripting and automation within After Effects, demonstrating an efficient use of scripting languages to direct software operations.
The plug-in operates on a hybrid model, embedding JavaScript scripts within C++ code, eliminating the need for external script files for operation.

Project Insights:

Features crafted from personal workflow optimization, such as automatic layer trimming, keyframe regrouping, dynamic marker comments, and linked layer effects, highlight a direct approach to addressing user needs through software solutions.
This Adobe After Effects plug-in encapsulates a deep understanding of software extension development, leveraging core programming skills to enhance digital content creation workflows.

Notes:

This repository hosts only original code and does not include the After Effects SDK files that would be needed to compile it
